# ✅ Fixes Applied - Download & Delete

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **YouTube Download 403 Errors** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- yt-dlp was getting HTTP 403 Forbidden errors from YouTube
- All download formats were being blocked
- Downloads were timing out or failing completely

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated yt-dlp to latest version (2025.10.22)
- ✅ Changed Strategy 1 to use **Format 18 (360p MP4)** - most reliable format that bypasses restrictions
- ✅ Added `--no-check-certificate` flag
- ✅ Reduced timeouts from 5 minutes to 2 minutes for faster failure detection
- ✅ Better error truncation in logs (first 80 chars only)

**New Download Strategies:**
1. **Format 18 (360p)** - Most compatible, always available ⭐
2. **Best under 480p** - Higher quality fallback
3. **Worst quality** - Smallest file, last resort

### 2. **Delete Functionality Missing** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- No way to delete intros from the frontend
- Database could only grow, never shrink

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `DELETE /api/intros/:id` endpoint to backend
- ✅ Added `deleteById()` method to Intro model
- ✅ Added DELETE case to database query handler
- ✅ Added `deleteIntro()` function to frontend API client
- ✅ Added delete button to IntroCard component (appears on hover)
- ✅ Added confirmation dialog before deletion
- ✅ Automatic UI refresh after deletion

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If downloads still fail:
1. **Check video is not age-restricted** (requires sign-in)
2. **Check video is not private** (owner only)
3. **Check video is not region-blocked** (geo-restrictions)
4. **Try a different video** (some videos have special protections)

### If delete doesn't work:
1. **Check terminal** for error messages
2. **Verify backend is running** (http://localhost:3000)
3. **Check browser console** for errors
4. **Refresh page** and try again
