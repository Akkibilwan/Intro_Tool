# ✅ Gemini Prompt Fixed

## 🐛 The Problem

**Symptom:** Intros not saving - AI analysis failing with "Failed to parse Gemini response as JSON"

**Root Cause:** The prompt was asking Gemini to write a "professional director's analysis in vivid prose", so Gemini returned a detailed narrative essay instead of JSON:

```
"Of course. Here is a professional director's analysis of the first minute...

***

The video opens without any title or content-warning cards, immediately immersing the viewer...

**0:00 – 0:18: Establishing the Scale**

The opening is a single, static, and starkly symmetrical wide shot..."
```

This caused JSON parsing to fail, so the intro couldn't be saved.

## ✅ The Fix

**Changed the prompt from:**
```
"You are a professional film and video director tasked with analyzing... 
describe, in vivid prose, how it is edited and captured..."
```

**To:**
```
"CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No other text.

Analyze this video intro and return ONLY this JSON structure:
{ ... }

RULES:
- Return ONLY the JSON object
- No markdown, no explanations, no prose
- Start with { and end with }
```

## 🧪 Testing

To test if it's working now, save a new intro via the extension:

1. Go to YouTube video
2. Open extension
3. Enter times (00:00:00 to 00:00:10)
4. Click "Save Intro"
5. Watch backend logs

**Expected output:**
```
🤖 STEP 2/3: Analyzing with Gemini AI...
📄 Gemini response received
📝 Response preview: {"description":"...
✅ Video analysis complete
   Mood: Energetic
   Style: Modern
   Pace: fast
```

**If it works:** Intro will save successfully

**If it still fails:** Share the error from backend logs
