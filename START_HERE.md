### For Publishing to Chrome Web Store:

1. **Prepare Icons:**
   - Create professional 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 PNG icons
   - Use a tool like Canva or hire on Fiverr ($5-20)

2. **Update API URL:**
   - Open `extension/popup/popup.js`
   - Change line 7 from:
     ```javascript
     const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
     ```
   - To your deployed backend URL:
     ```javascript
     const API_URL = 'https://your-backend.railway.app/api';
     ```

3. **Create ZIP File:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/ankushchaudhary/Desktop/Intro Tool"
   zip -r extension.zip extension/ -x "*.DS_Store" "*/README.md"
   ```

4. **Submit to Chrome Web Store:**
   - Go to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole
