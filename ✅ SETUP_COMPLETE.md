## 🚀 Extension Deployment

### Current Status: Developer Mode ✅
**You're already using it!**

### What is Developer Mode?
- Extension loaded locally in Chrome
- Perfect for personal use and testing
- Free!
- No approval needed
- Works exactly the same as published extensions

### Should I publish to Chrome Web Store?

**Keep Developer Mode if:**
- ✅ Using it yourself
- ✅ Sharing with small team (< 10 people)
- ✅ Still testing and developing
- ✅ Don't want to pay $5 fee

**Publish to Web Store if:**
- You want public distribution
- Need 100s or 1000s of users
- Want professional credibility
- Ready for production

### How to Publish (when ready):
See: **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** for complete instructions

**Quick summary:**
1. Deploy backend to Railway (~$5/month)
2. Update extension's API URL to production
3. Create professional icons
4. Pay $5 Chrome Web Store fee
5. Submit for review (1-3 days)

**For now:** Just use Developer Mode! 🎯
